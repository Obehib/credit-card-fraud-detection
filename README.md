Credit card fraud happens when a non- owner of a card uses a third partiesâ€™ card to transact business without the knowledge of the person. In many cases, a fraudster can obtain your financial information and use it to make fraudulent purchases. 
In view of some of the ways through which credit card fraud occurs, this project is aimed at using the available machine learning algorithms and technics to aid financial institutions and clients detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We hope that, we will be able to establish insights to help both parties to identify fraudulent transactions thereby saving them from loss of money.
The machine learning algorithms we used are Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and K-Means Clustering in predicting genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions. In all, we seek to understand how the various chosen algorithms will be meaningful in establishing weather there is a higher magnitude of credit card fraud or no fraud. We will use the selected Machine learning Algorithms to analyze and predict large data looking for patterns and anomaly. 

This dataset and information was gotten from:  (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

A dataset of 284,807 sample size of credit card transaction in September 2013 by European cardholders was used for the analysis. This transaction was carried out in two days and it contains 492 fraud and its variable include, numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. The fraudulent transaction makes up only 0.1727% of all the transactions making the dataset highly unbalanced.
